# Spicy parser for IEC 60870-5-104

IEC 60870-5-104 Parser - Network access for IEC 60870-5-101 using standard transport profiles.

## Overview

IEC60870_5_104 is a Zeek plugin (written in [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/)) for parsing and logging fields used by the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol as presented in the standard IEC 60870-5-104:2006 and IEC 60870-5-101:2003, defining a transmission format for sending and receiving SCADA data in power systems.

This parser produces the following log files, defined in [scripts/main.zeek](scripts/main.zeek):

* `104.log`

For additional information on this log file, see the *Logging Capabilities* section below.

## Installation

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html). It requires [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/) and the [Zeek Spicy plugin](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/zeek.html).

```bash
cd IEC60870-5-104
cmake . && make install
zeek -NN | grep IEC60870_5_104
```

If this package is installed from `zkg` it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly you will see `ANALYZER_SPICY_IEC608070_5_104` under the list of `Zeek::Spicy` analyzers.

If you have `zkg` configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [`zkg` Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

### Test

The script can tested immideatly with

```bash
$ zeek -r <pcapfile> iec60870_5_104.hlto ./scripts/main.zeek 
Initializing IEC 60870-5-104 analyzer
```

Now, in the folder lies an `conn.log`and the application log `iec_104.log`.

## Finalize installation

In order to including the parser into zeeks scripting land the folder has to copy into zeek. In the follwing example the installation path to zeek is`/opt/`

```bash
cd /opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/protocols
sudo mkdir iec60870-5-104/
cp <path_to_folder IEC60870-5-104>/scripts/* opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/protocols/iec60870-5-104/
cd /opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/
<texteditor> init-default.zeek
```

```bash
# <insert a command if you want here>
@load base/protocols/iec60870-5-104
```

Idealy, the line is inserted where the other base protocols are listed. An command can be included by using the # sign.

## Protocol support and limitations

This parser has implemented and tested the following message types according to the IEC 60870-5-104 standard (see IEC 60870-5-104: 6 Auswahl von ASDU aus IEC 60870-5-101 und zus√§tzliche ASDU):
