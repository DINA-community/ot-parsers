# IEC 61850-MMS parser

IEC 61850-8-1 (MMS) Parser - Communication networks and systems for power utility automation: Mappings to MMS (ISO 9506-1 and ISO 9506-2).

## Overview

IEC61850_MMS is a Zeek plugin (written in [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/)) for parsing and logging fields used by the IEC 61850-8-1 (MMS) protocol as presented in the standard IEC 61850-8-1 and ISO 9506-2, defining a transmission format for exchanging time-critical and non-time-critical data through local-area networks by mapping ACSI to MMS frames.

This parser produces the following log files, defined in [scripts/main.zeek](scripts/main.zeek):

* `mms.log`
* `mms_<servicename>.log`

For additional information on this log file, see the *Logging Capabilities* section below.

## Installation

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html). It requires [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/) and the [Zeek Spicy plugin](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/zeek.html).

```bash
$ cd IEC61850/MMS
$ cmake . && make install
$ zeek -NN | grep ANALYZER_SPICY_IEC61850_MMS
```

If this package is installed from `zkg` it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly you will see `ANALYZER_SPICY_IEC61850_MMS` under the list of `Zeek::Spicy` analyzers.

If you have `zkg` configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [`zkg` Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

## Protocol support and limitations

## Logging Capabilities

### IEC 61850-8-1 (MMS) Log (MMS.log)

This log summarizes, by connection, IEC 61850-8-1 (MMS) frames transmitted over 102/tcp to `MMS.log`.

#### Fields Captured

This packages captures different characteristics from captured MMS packages. These characteristics can be used to be written into log files.
The Zeek script within this packages is an example for the logging capabilities.
The following is an example from the MMS identify service:

```
#fields	ts	uid	invokeID	vendor	modelName	revision
#types	time	string	int	string	string	string
1680702688.839633	C3eiCBGOLw3VtHfOj	1	-	-	-
1680702688.840122	C3eiCBGOLw3VtHfOj	1	ksc	Resist Server	1.5.1
```

For every mms package the following informations are written to the file mms.log.

| Field                  | Type           | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- |----------------|------------------------------------------------------| 
| ts                     | time           | Timestamp (network time)                             |
| uid                    | string         | Unique ID for this connection                        |
| mms_type               | enum           | MMS PDU type                                         |

To get an idea which fields can be wirtten to the log files have a look into the [Baseline](testing/Baseline/) folder.

#### Community ID

When used with Zeek 6.0.0 or above the communityID is also written to the conn.log
